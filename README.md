# xd1.dev

This is the repository that is the source of truth for my blog hosted at <https://xd1.dev>.

The automation is based on the upstream repo, but is heavily modified to make it easy for me to upload images to github and have them reflected in the blog, as well as
fixing some quirks in the way that weblog handles markdown, so that it plays well with prism.js for displaying code with syntax highlight.
