# Getting started

Your weblog consists of these things:

- A **configuration** file that defines settings, rules, and small template patterns for certain types of weblog output
- A **main template** file that defines the structure and appearance of your weblog pages
- **Entries**, which are in Markdown, and can be either **posts**, **pages**, or additional templates

You can manage your weblog through the omg.lol weblog user interface, or through your own editor of choice using a GitHub action. More on that later.
