# Hyprland crash course

For the past week I have been configuring hyprland and using it as my daily driver.
Coming from major Desktop Environments like KDE or Gnome, this was definitely quite challanging,
specially when implementing features that we take it for granted on these DEs, like screen sharing or screenshot annotating.

In this post I will be going through all the tools and scripts I have been creating to configure this amazing Window Manager to my liking.

## Introduction

First things first, the system I daily drive is Archlinux, and it comes with its own set of pros and cons.
However specially for hyprland, everything is available from the package manager. Apparently nix configurations are also very well supported.
Other system architectures might not have such a thorough support from the distro.
