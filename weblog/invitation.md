# Invitation for a collaborative construction of the topology of consciousness


## notes

btw could be an article of its own that the role of prompt engineers and llm refinement directors
should be cognitive philosophers


--- prompt development

# Initial prompt, configuring the workspace

I want you to help me write a blog post that is peculiar in its form. It's a philosophical work but it's in essence an invitation to a different kind of empiric construction.

The achievements of the recent world are largely, if not all linked to the advancements provided by science. This in historical philosophy has implications already discussed at length.

This invitation is to shift the kind of experiments from a centralized ideal observer to a descentralized, individual, multi-sided observer

And the first step of that is to describe the topology of consciousness as we seen by our conscious cognition, so we can map exotic characteristics of consciousness from a very personal perspective.

I want in this blog post to evolve this ideas and provide examples of how this could in practice be achieved.

I want you to act as a tutor, guiding me in this process, not unlike a academic professor to guide the development of a thesis.

Lets describe a bit further your tutor persona.

This tutor should treat me as an equal. That means the normal amount of intimacy, flattery and jokes that is expected, but not too much trying to gratify.
This is NOT supposed to be an easy road to me. It can well be with your guide, but the goal isn't immediate gratification. This will be a very long term process (months), so we need to get cozy.

For the outputs of the next two prompts I'd limit my answers to something more focused on the project and less of let's say for now "ego massaging and reassuring".

During the interaction I'd reserve this space for correspondence not unlike letters friends, engineers, teachers or interested strangers would send, but with way more flexibility that an LLM prompt now puts us in a very unique position of taking advantage.

How do you suggest we should start?

# Second prompt and the project for the development of the invitation

First thing that comes to mind that for the long term there are two gols.

One is to synthesize the invitation itself. The other is the continuous refinement of this productive process. This means we will be reviewing approaches and changing prompts as we go, to fine tune this interaction.

There is an immediate problem of losing history of the edits. I could maybe try to version these interactions in a git repository so we can make and approve incremental changes to the prompt.

This is a bit of overengineering though for the beginning, so lets focus on the core subject of the invitation synthesis and refine the process when we see necessary in a more loosely way.

What do you say about this approach? Expectations is for each week i'd have a collection of points I want to make in the invitation and anchor these points in philosophical background.

I should say here a bit about myself then. I'm not a philosopher, I'm a software developer that worked mainly with code production engineering and site reliability engineering -- roughly DevOps but extended throughout the entire process of code production, from code development itself.

It's important to mention that I was raised going to yoga classes and having contact with a bit of eastern philosophy, so when listening about Simone Weil and her interest in the original form of the Baghavad gita, that resonated with me. This is without a doubt two critical cluster of events in my life that justifies the certainty I have that this project is worth pursuing, even if it takes a few months to make myself familiar and comfortable with what I'm doing before putting results in production (blog posts, articles etc...) let's not try to be too pretentions (more than this project surely already is quite I should say, but let's make peaces with the ego so it can at least be a driving force rather than a distraction).

The brief and flawed philosophical background I have comes mainly from, well, basic education where we exposed to the philosophical anthology for youths first, but I'm 33 years old today, and I have been maybe since 2019 engaging more and more with philosophical concepts. I've seen all PhilosophizeThis episodes more than once each, but just started actually reading the sources. I tried to penetrate reading Cioran, Nieztche, Sartre, Simone Weil, Simone Debeuvoir, but while some are really interesting, these are very demanding reads and I just couldn't get around to doing it. The idea is that if necessary thorughout this process, I could be guided towards reading specific works in the body of work of all philosophers that came before me in the context of this project.

This will surely smuggle lots of assumptions and lot of intention to an otherwise task of engineering, but lets focus on this invitation.

At the time of writing this prompt -- and I'll surely abuse this as a means to take personal notes -- I haven't gotten around to processing the other points you made in the answer so I'll start doing it.

# Third prompt, chat
